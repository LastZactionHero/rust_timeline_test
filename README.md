## Song Name Prompt
This is a song from a bespoke music player. 

Format: 
24: As3-8 D4-8
[time point in 32'nds]:[A#3 for 8 32'nd count],[D4 for 8 32'd counts]

So, this means that at the 3rd quarter note of the song, start playing A#3 and D4, both for 1/4 note.

Given this, I'd like you to describe this song as a filename for a synthesizer without a keyboard. Give it a name that fits the melody as you see it.

Output as:

[song_name]

and I'll merge this into a full string, like: `20240218_song_name.song`
